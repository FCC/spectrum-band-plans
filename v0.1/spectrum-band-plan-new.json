It is what carries voice between cell phones, television shows from broadcasters to your TV, and online information from one computer to the next, wirelessly. This version provides basic, plain language information about frequencies generally deemed appropriate for mobile broadband (225 MHz to 3700 MHz.) including 700 MHz, 800 MHz Cellular, Advanced Wireless Service (AWS), Broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS), Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational Broadband Service (EBS), 2.3 GHz Wireless Communications Service (WCS), Full Power TV Broadcast and Mobile Satellite Services (MSS).",
